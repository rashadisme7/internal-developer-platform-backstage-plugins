# @openchoreo/create-portal

## 1.6.0-m.2-eval

### Minor Changes

- 858ed02: New `npx @openchoreo/create-portal` CLI that scaffolds a custom OpenChoreo
  Portal: a thin Backstage app on the published portal packages, pinned to one
  release. The template is rendered from the live monorepo at pack time
  (private assistant wiring stripped, every `@openchoreo/*` package pinned to
  the lockstep release version through root `resolutions`), ships inside the CLI tarball, and is pushed to the
  `openchoreo/portal-template` repo per release as the `git merge` upgrade
  base.
